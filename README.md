Package `vfs` provides an abstraction of the `os` and `ioutil` packages that is
easy to test.

## Key features

 * File system abstraction layer for commonly-used `os` and `ioutil` functions
   from the standard library.

 * Powerful testing framework, `vfst`. For a quick tour of `vfst`'s features,
   see [the examples in the
documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/twpayne/go-vfs/vfst#pkg-examples).

## Quick start

`vfs` provides implementations of the `FS` interface:

```go
// An FS is an abstraction over commonly-used functions in the os and ioutil
// packages.
type FS interface {
    Chmod(name string, mode os.FileMode) error
    Chown(name string, uid, git int) error
    Chtimes(name string, atime, mtime time.Time) error
    Create(name string) (*os.File, error)
    Lchown(name string, uid, git int) error
    Lstat(name string) (os.FileInfo, error)
    LstatIfPossible(name string) (os.FileInfo, bool, error)
    Mkdir(name string, perm os.FileMode) error
    Open(name string) (*os.File, error)
    OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm os.ModePerm) (*os.File, error)
    ReadDir(dirname string) ([]os.FileInfo, error)
    ReadFile(filename string) ([]byte, error)
    Readlink(name string) (string, error)
    Remove(name string) error
    RemoveAll(name string) error
    Rename(oldpath, newpath string) error
    Stat(name string) (os.FileInfo, error)
    Symlink(oldname, newname string) error
    Truncate(name string, size int64) error
    WriteFile(filename string, data []byte, perm os.FileMode) error
}
```

To use `vfs`, you write your code to use the `FS` interface, and then use
`vfst` to test it.

`vfs` also provides functions `MkdirAll` (equivalent to `os.MkdirAll`) and
`Walk` (equivalent to `filepath.Walk`) that operate on an `FS`.

The implementations of `FS` provided are:

 * `OSFS` which calls the underlying `os` and `ioutil` functions directly.

 * `PathFS` which transforms all paths to provide a poor-man's `chroot`.

 * `ReadOnlyFS` which prevents modification of the underlying FS.

 * `TestFS` which assists running tests on a real filesystem but in a temporary
   directory that is easily cleaned up.

Example usage:

```go
// writeConfigFile is the function we're going to test. It can make arbitrary
// changes to the filesystem through fs.
func writeConfigFile(fs vfs.FS) error {
    return fs.WriteFile("/home/user/app.conf", []byte(`app config`), 0644)
}

// TestWriteConfigFile is our test function.
func TestWriteConfigFile(t *testing.T) {
    // Create and populate an temporary directory with a home directory.
    fs, cleanup, err := vfst.NewTestFS(map[string]string{
        "/home/user/.bashrc": "# contents of user's .bashrc\n",
    })

    // Ensure that the temporary directory is removed.
    defer cleanup()

    // Check that the directory was populated successfully.
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("vfsTest.NewTestFS(_) == _, _, %v, want _, _, <nil>", err)
    }

    // Call the function we want to test.
    if err := writeConfigFile(fs); err != nil {
        t.Error(err)
    }

    // Check properties of the filesystem after our function has modified it.
    vfst.RunTest(t, fs, "",
        vfst.PathTest("/home/user/app.conf",
            vfst.TestModeIsRegular,
            vfst.TestModePerm(0644),
            vfst.TestContentsString("app config"))),
}
```


## Motivation

`vfs` was inspired by
[`github.com/spf13/afero`](https://github.com/spf13/afero) and
[`github.com/twpayne/aferot`](https://github.com/twpayne/aferot). So, why not
use these?

 * `afero` has several critical bugs in its in-memory mock filesystem
   implementation `MemMapFs`, to the point that it is unusable for non-trivial
test cases.  `vfs` does not attempt to implent an in-memory mock filesystem,
and instead only provides a thin layer around the standard libary's `os` and
`ioutil` packages, and as such should have fewer bugs.

 * `afero` does not support creating or reading symbolic links, and its
   `LstatIfPossible` interface is clumsy to use as it is not part of the
`afero.Fs` interface. `vfs` provides out-of-the-box support for symbolic links
with all methods in the `FS` interface.

 * `afero` has been effectively abandoned by its author, and a "friendly fork"
   ([`github.com/absfs/afero`](https://github.com/absfs/afero)) has not seen
much activity. `vfs`, by providing much less functionality than `afero`, should
be smaller and easier to maintain.
